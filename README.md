Not just LLM integration but Automation integraton with LLM inside it to assist "Humans" in taking the final decision
LLMs: Probablistic in nature, generate next best possible outcome - Generates
Automation - Executioners in nature, automates task 





Automation will always beat random LLM implementations.

Salesforce recently made headlines for firing employees…
and then quietly pulling some of them back.

Why?

Because replacing humans with random AI experiments doesn’t scale.

What actually works is automation-first thinking, not “let’s plug in an LLM and see what happens.”

➊ LLMs are probabilistic → Automations are deterministic
➋ LLMs generate → Automations execute
➌ LLMs assist humans → Automations replace repetitive workflows

Companies don’t fail because they adopt AI.
They fail because they adopt AI without structure.

Real leverage comes when:
→ LLMs sit inside automated workflows
→ Clear inputs, rules, fallbacks, and approvals exist
→ Humans supervise outcomes, not prompts

AI is not an employee replacement.
Automation is.

LLMs are just one component in the system.

Build workflows first.
Add intelligence second.
